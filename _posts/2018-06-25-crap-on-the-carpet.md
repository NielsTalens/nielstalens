I had a talk once with a developer who complained about the status of their codebase. He showed me a piece of code and after we had a shared “Ooh THAT is crappy code” moment, he closed the file and continued his work. business as usual.

“Erm, yeah but…did you just…why don’t you….what?…”

It’s like someone walks in a white carpeted office while holding up his shoe and says “look everybody, I stepped in some dog shit” before putting the shoe right on and walking to the coffee machine. business as usual.

That was a good time to introduce the boy scout rule:

> ”leave the campground cleaner than you found it.”.

That's it. Happy camping y'all!
